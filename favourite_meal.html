    <h1>Amala and Abula</h1>
    <h4>Origin</h4>
    <p>Amala is made out of yam and/or cassava flour or unripe plantain flour. Tubers of yam are peeled, sliced,
        cleaned,dried and then blended into flour. It is also called elubo. Yams are white in color but turn
        brown when dried which gives the amala its color
    </p>

        <dt>Abula is a soup of the Yoruba peaople from Western Nigerian. It is typically eaten together with Amala, but 
        can be eaten with other swallow foods. Abula literally means a mixture of soups, but it is mostly associated 
        to gbegiri(beans soup), Ewedu(draw vegetable soup) and obe ata(stew). </dt>
    
    <dd>Gbegiri is a traditional Nigerian bean soup consisting of honey beans (also called brown beans), smoked or fresh fish,
        ground crayfish, palm oil, stock, ir√∫ (locust beans), salt, and pepper. The beans are soaked, peeled, and mashed to a smooth paste, which 
        is then combined with the other ingredients and cooked until the mixture reaches a slightly thickened consistency.
    </dd>
    <br>
    <dd>Ewedu soup is a soup created by the Yoruba ethnic group similar to Okra soup, it is made from jute leaf, hence
        it is known as jute leaf soup. The soup is drawy in texture and goes with Nigerian beef stew and fish stew.
    </dd>
